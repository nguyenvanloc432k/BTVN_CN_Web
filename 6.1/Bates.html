        Dear Sirs,
        
        <P CLASS="body">
        
        I am writing to inform you that, due to financial difficulties, I will be unable to pay my taxes this year.
        
        <P CLASS="body">
        
        You see, my company has had reduced profits this year. In fact gross revenues have now dropped below the GDP of <B>twelve</B> foreign countries! Given this intolerable situation, I am sure you will understand.

        The 23rd Psalm (King James Version)</H2>
        
        <SPAN>T</SPAN>he LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
        
        <P> He made me to lie down in green pastures: he led me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
